# Take the code from the How To Decode A Website exercise
# (if you didnâ€™t do it or just want to play with some different code,
# use the code from the solution), and instead of printing the results to a screen,
# write the results to a txt file. In your code, just make up a name for the file
# you are saving to.
# Extras:
# Ask the user to specify the name of the output file that will be saved.
